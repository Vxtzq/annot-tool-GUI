Report errors with the app error system.

# Dataset types
Two dataset types are supported :

- Dataset with classes as folders (e. g images/dataset/class1/img.png)
  
- Dataset with just images (e. g images/img1.png
  
To deal with the second option, tick the corresponding option in the start settings and enter the classes names, one by one, into the last textbox.
A preview of all the classes should be appearing under it.
